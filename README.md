## Sparse Modelling for Feature Learning in High-Dimensional Data
This project introduces a robust pipeline for wood surface defect detection employing various
machine learning techniques. The dataset comprises images of wood surfaces, and the primary
objective is to process, train models, and assess their performance in defect detection. The
workflow encompasses data loading, preprocessing, feature extraction and learning,
dimensionality reduction, and model training. Notably, the code leverages pre-trained models like
VGG19 and incorporates anomaly detection methods such as Isolation Forest and Local Outlier
Factor. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, F1 score, and visualizations, are employed to gauge
model performance. The project's distinctive focus lies in addressing the challenge of extracting
meaningful features from high-dimensional datasets. Sparse modeling techniques, specifically
Lasso and proximal gradient methods, are employed to efficiently reduce dimensionality while
enhancing interpretability. The overarching goal is to advance the field of wood surface defect
detection by providing a comprehensive framework that combines state-of-the-art machine
learning methods with sparse modeling techniques, ultimately contributing to more accurate and
interpretable results.
